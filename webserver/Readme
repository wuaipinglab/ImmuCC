The scripts in "RNASeq_pipeline.sh" are used to preprocess the RNA-Seq data(from "fastq" to "reads") in four major steps: quality control; mapping; bam file sorting; quantification. After that, the scripts in "HTSeq_stat.R" were used for merging the expression of immune receptor gene families and data normalization.

Notes:
1, For paired end sequencing data, the name of two fastq files should be ended with "_1.fastq" and "_2.fastq"; for single end sequencing data, the name for the single fastq file should ended with ".fastq". However, you can also modify our script according to your data.

2, You can download the lattest gtf and fastq file to build the reference data because there is duplicate gene symbols in previous versions.
   
3, You should better examine your data quality accrording to the result in the directory of "old_fastqc" and "new_fastqc". As our scripts will run all preprocessing steps at one time, the expression profile of those low quality data (For examble: high duplicating rates, low sequencing length et.al) should be removed as usual RNA-Seq analysis.

4, You should make sure the common genes bewteen our signature matrix and the expression profile of your sample is enough. You'd better process the raw sequencing data according to our pipeline here.

5, The matrix of your transcriptomal data should be separated by ",", "/t" or " " and the duplicated gene names should be removed before submit your job to our server.

6, For RNA-Seq data, reads counts calculated from HTSeq are used in our model. FPKM and TPM are not suggested in our web server.

7，If you cannnot access our webserver from the link:http://wap-lab.org:3200/immune/, you can open from: http://218.4.234.74:3200/immune/

8，There is something wrong for the results page URL emailed to you, please do not shut down the work page and download the result directly from this site.
